# ChiPy scikit-learn challenge
Small group exercise with Zaba, Rick, James and Katie

#Prerequisites
[ ] Python 3.3+
[ ] [jupter](http://jupyter.org/install)

# How to Use
Both jupyter notebooks - the original marked _orig included here can also be found in 
[ChiPy's repo](https://github.com/chicagopython/CodingWorkshops/blob/master/problems/data_science/Introduction_to_Text_Analysis_with_sklearn.ipynb) 
- can be accessed if you have both Python 3.3+ and jupyter installed. Just run `jupyter notebook` to start the jupyter notebook app, 
and a browser will open where you can select the notebook with which you'd like to work.
