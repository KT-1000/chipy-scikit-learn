## ChiPy scikit-learn challenge
This is a group challenge exercise completed by Zaba, Rick, James and Katie at ChiPy's June project night meeting.
We built a recommendation system to predict which talks a PyCon attendee would enjoy in 2018 based on the talks 
they attended at the same conference in 2017.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Python 3.3+
- [ ] [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install)

### How to Use
Both jupyter notebooks (the original included here marked _orig can also be found in 
[ChiPy's repo](https://github.com/chicagopython/CodingWorkshops/blob/master/problems/data_science/Introduction_to_Text_Analysis_with_sklearn.ipynb)) 
can be accessed by running `jupyter notebook` to start the jupyter notebook app, and then selecting the name of 
the notebook you'd like to work with from the browser that will open.
